### Hello world! 👋

I'm Fabio Tatti and I'm a Data Science and Engineering Graduate at Politecnico di Torino. I will graduate in December with a Master Thesis about Facial Emotion Recognition (FER), called "An emotional coherence analysis with a multimodal Neural Network - A study based on a novel affective dataset of facial expressions ". My studies did focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data Analysis.
