🔭 I’m **graduated** with my Master's Thesis project called "An emotional coherence analysis with a multimodal Neural Network - A study based on a novel affective dataset of facial expressions ". After the creation of a Dataset for FER by collecting facial RGB-D data in Rio de Janeiro (BR) I am focusing on the multimodal Neural Network able to classify them.
